Trading Script:

How it works:
This script pulls historical data from binance.us api, but executes purchases on coinbasepro.

I chose to use the binance.us API since it lets you pull 1000 candle sticks vs the 300 from coinbase.

It pulls the buy signal for both the Bollinger Bands and Simple Moving Average Strategies.

It then pulls the current price for the coin and the current price is pulled from coinbase.

Before buying it will check if the current price is below both of the buy signals. You are able to 
make it buy just based on either of the strategies by changing the if statment to say 'or' instead of 
'and' in the if statement for buy condition. There is a comment above that line to let you know.

At the end of the if conditon for buying it sets the sell signal 4% above what it bought at. This 
does not mean it will sell then. Once the current price is greater than the sell signal it sets a take
profit level 2% below the current price. So it has a minimum of 2%. Now the take profit level will adjust 
2% below the current price no matter how high it goes. So if the current price goes 10% higher than when
you bought, the take profit will be set at 2% below that. If the current price ever drops below or equal
to the take profit price then it will sell all of the coins the script is running on. I have commented on 
the code where you can adjust these numbers for the sell signal or take profit numbers.

Once it sells it will calculate the profit level so far it has made in the script and display it on
each iteration print out. The script also keeps track of how many times it has bought and sold.
The profit count will not be 100% accurate as I don't consider the trading fees when counting the
profit.

Lastly there is a stop loss. I set the stop loss to be at 10% below what you bought at. So if the strategy 
fails and the coin starts dropping it will sell all the coins if the price drops 10% below the bought price.

How to use:
You will need to coinbasepro account to be able to authenicate and make purchases. You will also need
a Twilio account to have the script text you of notifications, such as buying, take profit level reached,
selling, and stop loss. 

You will then need to create a config.py in the same folder that you run the script in. The config.py should be 
formatted as:

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#CoinbasePro API
apiKey = ""
apiSecret = ""
passphrase = ""

#Twilio API
account_sid = ""
auth_token = ""

#Twilio Cell info
from_ = ""
to = ""

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then just put the API information inside the quotations.

Once you have the config.py filled in and in the same directory as the trading script you are ready to run it.
